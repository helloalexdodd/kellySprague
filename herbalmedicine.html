			<h3>What is Herbal Medicine?</h3>
			<p>Herbal medicine is the use of plant remedies in the treatment of disease and for the improvement of health. It is the
			oldest form of medicine known, and as much as 80% of the world’s population still depend on herbs. Many of today’s drugs
			are based on simple constituents extracted from plants, but whole plants contain thousands of chemicals. Herbalists
			believe that the simple active constituents of plants are balanced, and made safer and more effective by the presence of
			these other chemicals. Not only are whole plants used, but usually combinations of plants are prepared as formulas
			specifically designed to meet the needs of the individual client. Our ancestors, perhaps by trial and error, found the
			most effective local plants to heal their diseases. Now, with the advancement of science enabling us to identify the
			chemical constituents within these plants, we can begin to understand some of their healing powers. Although modern
			clinical trials may not be available for many herbal remedies, the herbalist draws on thousands of years of empirical
			evidence in determining the best remedy.</p>
