				<h3>What is herbalism?</h3>
				<p>Herbalism or herbal medicine is working with plants to address illness or imbalance and support full body health. Herbalism focuses on the cause of the issue, rather than treating the symptoms. By getting down to the root cause, herbs can help the body heal itself and maintain long term health, especially when used in conjunction with diet and/or lifestyle support.</p>
				<h3>What can herbs help me with?</h3>
				<p>Herbal medicine can be helpful with a wide variety of issues including digestion, hormones, fatigue, headaches, and anxiety - just to name a few. Herbs can be supportive in chronic, longstanding conditions as well as acute health concerns. In many cases they can be used as a primary treatment, but also work well alongside other existing protocols and plans you might be following.</p>
				<h3>What is an appointment like?</h3>
				<img src="./assets/plant-4.svg" alt="">
				<p>In your initial appointment (roughly 75 minutes), we’ll go through a full health history intake. We’ll chat, without judgement, about your past and present health concerns and patterns, your lifestyle, and in what areas you’d like to feel better.  I’ll build you a custom herbal formula and we’ll discuss next steps and tools specific to your individual needs. The herbal formula, which might be a tincture (alcohol extract) or a tea, is blended for you from my dispensary. Each herb is chosen for its potential to work specifically with your body, and in combination with the other herbs in your formula (wow!). The beauty of a custom blend is that every herb is specific to you and your needs, and we can make shifts in the formula to follow shifts in your body + mind.</p>
